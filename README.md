# simplejms

This code complies with the course "Enterprise Computing" I taught. This repository has two significant folders,  "IntelliJ" and "java_code." The "intellij" folder contains the complete project files you can open using the Intellij editor. Each project uses Artemis ActiveMQ 2.38 as a JMS provider. You may need to modify the dependency tag in the "pom.xml" file if you use other providers. The name of the connection factory, queue, and topic objects are defined in the file "jndi.properties." 

The "java_code" folder contains only Java source codes for each project. You can start creating your projects from Scratch and copy the code to save time writing all the codes yourself.
